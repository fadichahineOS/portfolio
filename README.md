# Portfolio
A website to showcase myself, my education, my experience, and my projects.

The website is a simple emulation of a macOS desktop, with the option to click on visual studio code to read a series of markdown files about me!
# How to install and run this website locally?
Clone this repository, make sure you have pnpm install, then proceed to run the following commands.

```bash
pnpm install
# then
pnpm run dev
```

# Motivation
This website was meant to recapture the passion I lost for software development during the pandemic and the harder parts of University, and showcase that passion to the world. I felt that showcasing my experience in what is considered many coders' home, VSCode, was the most appropriate way to list out my information. 

# Moving Forward

As most of the software I've worked on outside of University is not my own to publish, I currently do not have much to showcase on my Github, or this website. As time progresses though, I intend to update this website with current information, and integrate my personal projects as components to be accessed through the "desktop". I also intend to polish the app further, adding small functionalities to make the emulation of the macOS desktop feel more and more real. Just small things such as the top bar icons and drop down menus being interactive, and the app bar opening simple components to play around with the website. At any rate, thanks for giving this project a look!
